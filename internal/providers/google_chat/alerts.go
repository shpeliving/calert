// InitPruner is used to remove active alerts in the
// map once their TTL is reached. The cleanup activity happens at periodic intervals.
// This is a blocking function so the caller must invoke as a goroutine.
// The reason for this background worker is
// 1) Alertmanager doesn't have any unique ID for a generated alert. The use case is to send
// all the future alerts for same labels in a same thread. Labels are computed via `.fingerprint` field which is a
// unique hash based on those labels. The problem here is that all future alerts for same labels will also have same
// fingerprint. This means that even after the status is Resolved, we will continue posting to same thread if we use this
// fingerprint. This is undesirable, we ideally want each thread to have the last message as "Resolved".
// Now since there's no unique field, we maintain a map of active alerts. All the alerts will be stored here for a specified
// TTL.
// 2) Since we are storing the alerts in a map, this map will continue to grow unbounded.
// We need to have a TTL based expiry for these map keys. This is the most simple implementation to prune alerts by running this
// function as a GoRoutine and check if the alert creation timestamp has crossed our specified TTL. If it has, it'll delete the alert
// entry from the map.
// This check happens at a periodic interval specified by `pruneInterval` by the caller.
